Copy and paste files into your enigma main folder 
(i.e. the one that contains /rotors/ ect)

Then run chmod +x run.sh

Then run ./run.sh


This should generate a bunch of lines showing sucess where your error return
type matches what I expect. If your return type differs then you get a brief
description of the task you failed and the content of cerr.

Note, no doubt I have made loads of mistakes so please shout (or branch!) when
you find them.

Usual no warranties and so forth.
